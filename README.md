# my_advanced_fsm
Example of an advanced finite state machine for Godot 4.

It also includes other control versions, from a basic and without a design pattern spaghetti code, to a simple finite state machine to the advanced one.

This is an adaptation of [findemor](https://github.com/findemor)'s [sample project](https://github.com/findemor/findemor-youtube-ejemplo-maquina-estados-godot).
